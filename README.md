## About Me

I am currently a Master of Science candidate at Carnegie Mellon’s Heinz College of Public Policy and Management (expected graduation: December 2019). I have three years of experience working in international affairs, with expertise in data analytics, geographic information systems (GIS), program evaluation, and grant consulting/project management.

I graduated from the school of Arts & Sciences at Boston College in 2015 with majors in International Studies and Economics. My studies focused on the Middle East, including a semester abroad in Israel. Following graduation, I worked three months as a political section intern in the U.S. Embassy of Kuwait. I then served two years in central Ukraine as a Peace Corps Volunteer. This page will serve as an exhibit to my data visualization work from the course "Telling Stories with Data".
