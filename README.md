## About Me

I am currently a Master of Science candidate at Carnegie Mellon’s Heinz College of Public Policy and Management (expected graduation: December 2019). I have three years of experience working in international affairs, with expertise in data analytics, geographic information systems (GIS), program evaluation, and grant consulting/project management.

I graduated from the school of Arts & Sciences at Boston College in 2015 with majors in International Studies and Economics. My studies focused on the Middle East, including a semester abroad in Israel. Following graduation, I worked three months as a political section intern in the U.S. Embassy of Kuwait. I then served two years in central Ukraine as a Peace Corps Volunteer. This page will serve as an exhibit to my data visualization work from the course "Telling Stories with Data". 

You can learn more about me and my experiences at my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffreypflanz/). 

*Not the best at handwriting / handrawing... best to learn how to visualize data with technology* 

## What I Hope To Learn 

After doing some of the initial work, I am learning that I have a very poor sense of good color schemes and how to adjust colors/charts according to a given narrative. I simply want more and more practice of being given an idea/trend and learning how to display it with the correct mode and colors. 

Moreover, I want to continue to learn about the various online (open source) resources that can aid anyone with visualizing data. I hope to have the opportunity to open/practice Tableau as well.  

I simply want to practice, practice, [practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L29cuziRazU) taking raw requests / narratives and learning how to best visualize it. The exercises in the readings are a good start.
